# KNMI

The KNMI is the Royal Dutch Institute for Meteorology. They publish weather related data online, 
which is a trustworthy data source for weather in The Netherlands.

Weather data per day or even per hour can be downloaded from the following files:
- http://projects.knmi.nl/klimatologie/daggegevens/getdata_dag.cgi
- http://projects.knmi.nl/klimatologie/uurgegevens/getdata_uur.cgi

The weather information available includes temperature, wind, precipitation and more. Note that due
to relocations of measurement stations and changes in the observation methods, these time series 
may be inhomogenously. They are therefore not suited for trend analysis. Homogenous average monthly
temperatures since 1906 can be found here:
